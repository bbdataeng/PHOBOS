## ABSTRACT

## Introduction
This study aimed to investigate the prognostic and predictive value of DNA Damage Response and Repair (DDR) biomarkers in a cohort of 222 node-positive early breast cancer (BC) patients. The cohort was derived from a first-generation Phase III trial (GOIM 9902- Gruppo Oncologico Italia Meridionale) on adjuvant taxanes, which was previously conducted by our research group. A median follow-up of 64 months revealed that the addition of docetaxel (D) to epirubicin-cyclophosphamide (EC) did not result in any differences in disease-free survival (DFS) or overall survival (OS).

## Methods
The expression of DDR phosphoproteins (pATM, pATR, pCHK1, γH2AX, pRPA32 and pWEE1) in tumour tissue was assessed by immunohistochemistry. The association of these proteins with clinical outcomes was then evaluated using a regularised Cox elastic net model, with a ridge penalty being applied.

## Results 
We present an updated analysis with a median follow-up of 234 months. We assess differences in disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) between treatment arms (EC versus D followed by EC). Additionally, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the prognostic and predictive impact of DDR biomarkers, yielding significant insights.
